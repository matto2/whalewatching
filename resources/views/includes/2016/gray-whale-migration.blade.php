					<p>1/18/16 There are lots of gray whales migrating southbound along the Monterey Bay shoreline. Over the last week, large pods of dolphins and Orcas (killer whales) were also spotted in the bay. This is a good time for to see ocean birds, too, such as albatross, shearwaters, cormorants, brandts, loons and more!</p>
					<p>Winter until the spring is Gray Whale season in Monterey Bay. The chance of sighting California Gray Whales cross Monterey Bay during this period is around 90% as <a href="https://www.learner.org/jnorth/gwhale/" title="Migration" target="_blank">they migrate from cold arctic waters to the warm Baja Peninsula</a>.</p>

					<h2>Special Sighting – Fin Whales</h2>
					<p><em>June 1, 2016</em> Yesterday Fin Whales 2 by 2 cruised by the boat! That’s a rare sighting this close in. We've seen countless feeding blue whales and endless flirty humpbacks all week; We've been watching the blues just 3-4 miles out from Santa Cruz!</p>

					<p>We've noticed an unusual blue whale surface behavior: a sort of "charge" where they gain speed and blast across the water's surface. Join us this weekend to see the amazing wildlife of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary!</p>

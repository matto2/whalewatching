					<p>Monterey Bay whale watching offers seven different species of Whales and seven different species of Dolphin &amp; Porpoise year-round. The Humpback Whale is the most common whale found in Monterey Bay, seen usually from April through November. Monterey Bay whale watching is one of the most fascinating experiences watchers can immerse themselves in. It is richly diverse with marine life. Whale watchers are awestruck when seeing the California Gray whales, the humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales, and the blue whale, the largest animal to inhabit planet earth. They also get to see harbor seals, sea otters, bottlenose dolphins, and much more. Whale watching Monterey style means you get the experience of a lifetime.</p>

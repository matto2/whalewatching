					<p>Friday, March 13: Breaching humpback whales! Friday we saw ten humpback whales displaying epic surface behaviors – breaching, tail throwing, and pec-slapping right next to the boat. The action took place near Soquel Canyon  on the Santa Cruz side of Monterey Bay. Pleasant ocean conditions!</p>

					<p>Saturday, March 14: Whale watchers amazed by 45 minutes of breaches from a single humpback whale, followed by a pair of humpbacks feeding and diving. We also saw a pair of gray whales apparently mating, and a single "wheelie-popping" gray whale also breached!</p>

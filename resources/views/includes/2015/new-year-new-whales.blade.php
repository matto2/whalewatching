					<h3>New Year, New Whales</h3>
					<img src="/images/233.jpg" alt="Peak while Whale Watching in Monterey Bay California with Stagnaro Charters">
					<p>January 1, 2015 New Year's Day. The wind is down and the sun is up, a great day for whale watching! Today we saw COMMON DOLPHINS, a GRAY WHALE MOTHER AND CALF, and TEN HUMPBACK WHALES, breaching and one that breached multiple times near the boat.</p>
					<p>The highlight of this whale watching trip were the gray whales. Our naturalist Megan said that the baby gray whale was tiny, just a newborn! It’s unusual to see this early in the season, and what a sight for our crew and guests!</p>

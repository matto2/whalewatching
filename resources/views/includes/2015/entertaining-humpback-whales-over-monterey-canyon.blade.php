					<p>We've found some very entertaining humpback whales over Monterey Canyon this week on Velocity whale watching trips:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Wednesday 7/22: We found 4 humpback whales over the Monterey Canyon, and another individual near to Santa Cruz.</li>
						<li>Thursday 7/23: We found 3 humpback whales. One little guy was tail throwing right next to the boat—you could almost touch it!</li>
						<li>Friday 7/24: We patiently searched for a while before finding a very active humpback whale over Monterey Canyon. He was shy at first, but then put on quite the performance with several tail throws, and then wowed us with three full body breaches! We also saw California sea lions, sunfish, and a variety of seabirds.</li>
						<li>Next trips: Saturday (8am and 12pm), and Sunday, Monday &amp; Wednesday at 12pm. Call 831-427-0230 to reserve your tickets!</li>

					<p>Thursday 7/16: We found 10-12 humpback whales about 8 miles out; it was a long drive out there, but our first glimpse was a double breach! Throughout Most were diving for food, giving us some lovely looks at tail flukes, near and far. Also "logging," which is a whale just relaxing at the water's surface. And some splashy tail throws! We also saw Dall's porpoises – they are so fast! Otters loose from the kelp, sea lions frolicking way out over the Monterey canyon. More humpback whales appeared near to Santa Cruz on our way back to port. Jellyfish dotted the water as the sun was breaking through the morning fog. Great trip!</p>
					<p>Tuesday 7/14: We found three humpbacks, lots of flukes! We counted 12 bottlenose dolphins near the Cement Ship at Seacliff State Beach, cruising along with boat. We saw eight Great white sharks, two of which were alongside the boat for several minutes!</p>

					<p>Saturday 7/11: We saw four Humpback whales –one got kind of friendly, approaching the boat for some up-close looks. The highlight of the day was seeing a blue whale! We also got to watch two dozen Pacific white side dolphins out in the Monterey Bay.</p>

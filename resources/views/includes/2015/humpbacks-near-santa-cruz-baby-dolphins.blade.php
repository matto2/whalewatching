					<h3>Humpbacks near Santa Cruz, Baby Dolphins</h3>
					<p>11/11 Wednesday:  10 humpback whales today, some friendly whales approached nearby the boat for great looks. The whales were a bit closer in to Santa Cruz, about 5 miles offshore. During the later part of the trip we found 3-4 humpbacks lunge feeding near Santa Cruz. Also saw about 100 common dolphins – many young ones tagging along with mama dolphins!</p>
					<p>Humpbacks still here! Lots of great whale watching in Monterey Bay!</p>

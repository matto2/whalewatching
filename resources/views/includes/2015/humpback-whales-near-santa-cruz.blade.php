					<p>Saturday and Sunday we had 10-15 humpback whales each day, most whales are in the north bay on the Santa Cruz side of Monterey Bay. On Sunday, March 1, we had lunge feeding humpback whales at the surface, and witnessed several breaches in the distance. We saw 500-1000 common dolphins on both trips out this weekend! Today reports from the harbor that humpback whales can be seen breaching and lunge feeding on anchovies just a few miles offshore. Tickets available for whale watching trips this weekend:</p>

					<p>1/24/15 Great trip whale watching on our six-pack boat "Sea Stag Six" this weekend. With sunny winter conditions, it was fun day finding whales in Monterey Bay!</p>
					<p>We saw 4 humpback whales and 6 gray whales, with lots of tail flukes from both, and a couple of close drive-bys from a humpback whale. We saw whales from just two miles out from the Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor and out to the Monterey Canyon ten miles out!</p>
					<p>For the next few weeks, our large public tour boat Velocity is in the shipyard undergoing a complete re-powering. She will soon be powered by engines that meet the latest EPA standards in clean burning, fuel saving marine motors.</p>

					<p>We're taking reservations for whale watching on board Velocity February 13 and beyond.</p>

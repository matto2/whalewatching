					<p>Sunday, March 8 — Group of 5-8 humpback whales were feeding and surfacing very close to the boat! We stayed and watched the action for over an hour.</p>
					<p>Wednesday, March 11— A little rain won’t stop us! The sun came out as we ventured out onto flat calm seas. Passengers were treated to more surface feeding and activity near the boat by 4-5 humpback whales. Great looks at 2 gray whales on northbound migration.

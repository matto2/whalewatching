					<p>In the spirit of the #‎OptOutside‬ campaign to get out in Nature instead of shopping, we invite you to join us whale watching on Friday, Nov 27. Forget the mall; enjoy the beautiful Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary!</p>
					<p>Tuesday 11/24 Today another good show – We saw humpback whales and dolphins both – Singing in the rain!</p>
					<p>November 20-22: On all recent trips we've had scattered humpback whales not too far out of Santa Cruz. Whales are feeding and showing off a few good breaches, pec slapping. On Friday a nursery pod of common dolphins, bow riding, breaching, chirping. Sea otters lounging in the kelp.</p>

Wild free killer whales healthy living in Monterey Bay.</p>

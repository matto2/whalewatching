					<p> Whale watching in Monterey Bay offers seven different species of Whales and seven different species of Dolphin &amp; Porpoise year-round. The Humpback Whale is the most common whale found out of Santa Cruz, seen usually from April through November. Then from December through April, over 20,000 Gray Whales pass through our waters off of Santa Cruz. Sea Lions, Seals, Otters and nearly one hundred different species of sea birds, both endemic and migratory, are common; Even Sea Turtles, Jellies, Sunfish (mola mola) and Sharks at times can be seen at the surface. Our boat, the Velocity, can quickly and safely bring guests to wherever these animals are—from the shores of Monterey to Moss Landing and points North.</p>

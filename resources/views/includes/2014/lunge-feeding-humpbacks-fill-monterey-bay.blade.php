					<p>July 17-19, 2014: Thursday and Friday we had incredible amounts of lunge feeding humpback whales in Monterey Bay! We began to spot whale spouts out at the mouth of the submarine canyon. We saw very dramatic lunge feeding, spy-hopping, tail throws and pec slaps! Many whale behaviors were on display, mixed in with the odd breach here and there.</p>

					<p>Saturday there were more humpback whales over the canyon – over 20 whales were spotted! They were breaching high out of the water, One humpback whale "chin-slapped" for quite a while. A mother and calf did quite a few "drive-bys." They seem to be curious about the boat and all the interested passengers.</p>
					<p>All three days “Wilbur'” our resident humpback whale welcomed us back to Santa Cruz a quarter-mile off the beach and gave us close-up looks all three days. Wilbur is a little guy who has been feeding off Santa Cruz for almost two months now.</p>

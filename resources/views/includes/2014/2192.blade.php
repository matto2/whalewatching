					<p>Wednesday, August 27, 2014: Lots of whale and dolphin action this week on the Santa Cruz side of the bay, about 5-6 miles out from the Santa Cruz Harbor, over the Soquel Canyon. Yesterday we had a lot of fun with about 600 common dolphins frolicking alongside the boat. These dolphins were bow-riding, spinning, breaching and darting under the boat. Clear calm waters let us see them in the water down 20 feet!</p>

					<p>We also spotted 20 humpback whales, many doing close drive-bys near the boat – a few surface lunges near the boat, and many tail throws and breaching from distance.</p>
					<p>All last weekend we've  had active humpback whales, showing tail throws, pec slaps, breaching and close approaches, even under the boat! We count 15-20 whales on average each time we go out.</p>

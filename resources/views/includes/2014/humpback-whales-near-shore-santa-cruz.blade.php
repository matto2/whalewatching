					<p>Friday, October 3, 2014: We continue to see scattered humpback whales near shore at Santa Cruz, occasionally lunge feeding…More whales lunge feeding together out in the middle of the bay in groups of 6-10 humpback whales. We saw double-breaching whales Sunday and Monday, plus one pod of 6 dolphins swimming with 200 sea lions with really close drive-bys. October! Still excellent whale activity, and should stay sunny and warm through the weekend!</p>

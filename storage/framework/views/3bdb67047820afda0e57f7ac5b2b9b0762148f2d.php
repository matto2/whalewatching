					<p>Happy New Year! Even in late December the humpback whales are still populous in Monterey Bay. Whales are feeding on krill and anchovies out near Moss Landing and over the deep waters at the Monterey Canyon. We've been spotting multiple humpback whales each trip!</p>
					<p>Migration: We are also now seeing gray whales heading south to their winter breeding &amp; calving grounds in Baja California. Over 10,000 gray whales will pass through our waters this winter as they make the trek south to Baja then back north again in early spring.</p>

					<p>For now in Monterey Bay we continue to enjoy the antics of the lingering – and hungry – humpback whales.</p>
					<p>Friday, December 26: We saw about 6 humpback whales and also several gray whales on their southbound migration between Alaska and Baja California.</p>
					<p>Saturday, December 27: A terrific lunge feeding event in the middle of Monterey Bay. We counted about 30 humpback whales, with a fair amount of close "drive-bys" for amazing looks at the animals.</p>
					<p>Tuesday, December 30: A windy day out there, but wonderful sights of the humpback whales lunge feeding. The animals were feeding particularly close by the boat, giving passengers the opportunity to see lunge feeding from the perfect angles, great views of the whale "tongue" and baleen filters.</p>

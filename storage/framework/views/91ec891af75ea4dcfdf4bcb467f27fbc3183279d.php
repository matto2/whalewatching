					<p><em>Monday, August 29</em>We started the trip accompanied by a pod of 100 common dolphins, bow riding and traveling along with us through Monterey Bay! Later we found about 10 humpback whales and one blue whale. Today they were diving deep for food! But we got to see flukes and close looks while they were at the surface.</p>
					<p><em>Saturday &amp; Sunday August 27/28</em> The last two days we've had awesome looks at blue whales! Blue whales are in Monterey Bay is large numbers this season, and they are friendly! They'll swim close to the boat for great looks, and some have been seen lunge feeding!</p>
					<p>Also we've had very active humpback whales – lunge feeding and showing wonderful surface behaviors. Today one humpback whale was doing a circus routine: a triple tail slap, 3 head throws, and then 3 breaches which it repeated and repeated. Amazing!</p>
					<p>We also had Risso's dolphins further out in the bay.</p>

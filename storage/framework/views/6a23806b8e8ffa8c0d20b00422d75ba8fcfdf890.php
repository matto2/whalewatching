					<p><em>Sunday, May 1</em> Four humpback whales feeding on krill, lots of surface behavior, good looks at the whales! One gray whale.</p>
					<p><em>Sat, April 30</em> This morning we got lucky with humpback whales near shore, just a few miles off of Santa Cruz, plus and mama &amp; baby gray whales!</p>
					<p>Over the last four weeks we've seen orca on 4-5 different occasions and blue whale three times! Also sharks, otters, sea lions, birds and all the natural beauty of Monterey Bay.</p>
					<p>Here's a great article about our transient killer whales, their behavior and hunting patterns here in the bay: <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20160430/NEWS/160439987" title="Gary Griggs, Our Ocean Backyard: Killers in Monterey Bay">Gary Griggs, Our Ocean Backyard: Killers in Monterey Bay</a></p>

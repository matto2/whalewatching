					<p>Sunday, April 19: We saw large groups of 6+ BLUE WHALES mixing and mingling with HUMPBACK whales. There is plenty of krill for the whales to eat out at the canyons!</p>
					<p>Springtime in Monterey Bay also brings us humpback whales, orca, 5 species of dolphins, seals and sea lions, otters, plus countless migrating and pelagic birds. Our next trips are Friday 4/24 at 12:00 pm &amp; Saturday 4/25 at 10:00 am. More trips available most weekends and selected weekdays.</p>

					<p>The Blue Whale is the largest animal to ever inhabit the earth including the dinosaurs. In the early days blues reached 125' in length and 150 tons. Today they rarely exceed 90'. They are found in all oceans but are endangered, approximately 10,000 worldwide. Their distinctive high spout can reach over 25' and be spotted many miles away. Blue whales can usually be found in the bay in the spring and summer when they feed on krill (small shrimp like crustaceans).</p>

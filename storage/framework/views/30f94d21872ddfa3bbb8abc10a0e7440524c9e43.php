					<p>Here are the latest sightings on Monterey Bay: On Tuesday April 14 we saw one dozen humpback whales! The whales gave us some good drive-bys for close looks at these amazing animals! Whales were spotted in the center of the Bay near Monterey Canyon, about 5 miles offshore from Santa Cruz. There were at least 200 sea lions and 200 short-beaked common dolphins near Capitola, about 6 miles out.</p>
					<p>There are at least 5 species of dolphins and porpoises seen throughout the year in Monterey Bay. The short-beaked common dolphin is a species of Common Dolphin. The color pattern on the body is unusual. The back is dark and the belly is white, while on each side is an hourglass pattern colored light grey, yellow or gold in front and dirty grey in back.</p>
					<p>We are also enjoying the <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/article/velella-wash-ashore-by-the-billions/1056418" title="Seasonal Appearance" target="_blank">seasonal appearance of the Velella</a>, a relative of jellyfish. These bright blue, "sailed" creatures blow along the ocean surface and onto our local beaches.</p>
					<p>Humpback whales are abundant this season in Monterey Bay! They are arriving early for their annual feeding season. Since April 1 we've also spotted blue whales, Orca, and gray whales completing their annual migration. Join us on a whale watching trip on board Velocity! Our whale watching trips depart out of Santa Cruz at the north end of Monterey Bay. BUY TICKETS</p>

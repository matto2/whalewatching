					<p>Well, it keeps getting better and better! The Blue Whales are in Monterey bay too!! Monday we were only three miles out from Santa Cruz when we came upon a huge Blue AND a Fin Whale lunge feeding on krill. We watched for over an hour as the 80+ foot blue herded the massive schools of krill to the surface, turning the water red from the krills coloration. We felt pretty small! Next we headed out only another mile where we found a dozen or more Humpback Whales also feeding…….then one animal did a full body breech!, leaping and get its 45 foot and 40 ton body completely out of the water..it was awesome. We also hear of Blue whales and Humpbacks in Monterey too. Now is the time to go, the Bay is infested with Whale!!</p>

					<p>Lots of humpbacks in middle of Monterey Bay! On the Tuesday whale watching trip we saw 25 whales with a couple of tail throws and close drive bys! Recent trips we have seen one whale in particular that's been feeding on anchovies in the north Bay waters, off our home harbor of Santa Cruz.</p>
					<p>Join us whale watching on Monterey Bay! Our next outing is tomorrow, June 26, departing from the Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor at 11:00 AM.</p>

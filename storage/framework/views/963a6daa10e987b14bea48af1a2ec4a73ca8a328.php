					<p>A variety of whales!

					<p>We are still seeing a variety of whales on Monterey Bay as is fairly customary for this time of year. With some Humpback Whales starting to show up for summer feeding, there are still Gray whale mother/calf pairs heading past Santa Cruz on their way bay to <p>Alaska for the summer. And if that's not enough there have been numerous sightings of Killer Whales (Orca) as well. They are known to predate on Gray whales during spring migration. There have even been Blue Whales spotted in the bay! It’s a good time to get out on the water!

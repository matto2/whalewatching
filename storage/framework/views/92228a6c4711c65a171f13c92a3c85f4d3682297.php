					<p>Tuesday 9/20/16: Late season humpback whales are feeding around the Monterey Bay Canyon. Today we found 10 humpbacks feeding all together – we were near enough for some close “drive-bys,” and energetic surface behaviors! Plenty of spouts, pec slaps, great looks at flukes as the whales dove down below the water.</p>
					<p>Two species of dolphin joined in the feeding – Pacific white-sided dolphins and short-beaked common dolphins, along with a big pack of California sea lions. Birds, too! We saw a black-footed albatross, and many shearwater spp.</p>

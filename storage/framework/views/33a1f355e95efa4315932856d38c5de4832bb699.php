					<p>Monday, October 6, 2014: Sunday we had a super warm day on the bay! Hundreds – rafts – of California sea lions were interacting together with humpback whales. We had nice close looks at 10-15 humpback whales near Moss Landing, with many more whales in sight farther out over the deepest parts of the Monterey Bay Canyon.</p>
					<p>Today we had a great display of humpback whales surface lunge feeding, vertical lunges out at the Soquel Hole, near Santa Cruz. We saw about 7-8 humpback whales out near Soquel Hole, but one guy was exploring very close to Santa Cruz just a mile out from the Harbor. We also had a group of bottlenose dolphin riding along with us just outside the Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor.</p>
					<p>Next whale watching trips are this weekend – Friday through Monday. Plus,</p>
					<p>BONUS: Fireworks Cruise! Saturday night, October 11, 7-10 PM for the Monte Foundation Benefit Fireworks Show over Capitola Village!</p>
					<p>And, this coming Monday, October 13, is Columbus Day! Climb aboard “Velocity” to explore the Monterey Bay!</p>

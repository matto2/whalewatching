					<p>Gray whale season is in full swing on Monterey Bay! Each year more than 20,000 gray whales pass through Monterey Bay waters during their annual migration between Alaska and Baja, Mexico. <a href="http://www.montereyherald.com/environment-and-nature/20150117/a-winters-watch-scientists-track-whale-migration-from-big-sur-bluffs" title="Keep an eye out as gray whales can often be seen from shore!" target="_blank">Keep an eye out as gray whales can often be seen from shore!</a>  This winter we have a small population of humpback whales who are either staying late or arriving early. Dolphins, sea lions, otters and birds make whale watching an amazing wildlife tour.</p>

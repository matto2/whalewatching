					<h1>Scatterings at Sea</h1>

					<p><img src="/images/scatterings.jpg" alt="Scatterings at Sea"></p>

					<p>The scattering of a loved one’s ashes at sea is a dignified, timeless tradition. The beauty and power, the peace and tranquility of the waters of Monterey Bay make it an idyllic final resting place.</p>

					<p>Stagnaro Charters offers private ash scatterings aboard “Velocity”, Monterey Bay’s newest and modern passenger yacht. We are based out of the beautiful ocean-front community of Santa Cruz, the closest seaport to much of the San Francisco Bay area.</p>

					<p>All of our ash scatterings will take place on the pristine waters of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p>

					<p>Trips are up to one hour, giving you approximately 30 minutes to have your memorial. Longer trips can be arranged at additional cost. A certificate of Latitude and Longitude is included.</p>

					<h5>The cost is $650</h5>
					<p>$650 for the scattering of one individual. $100 for each additional urn to be scattered. Permit required for all boxes of remains.</p>

					<p>Our 60 foot power yacht, Velocity, is U.S. Coast Guard certified to accommodate up to 66 guests and features a snack and beverage bar with wine, champagne and beer sales available.</p>

					<p>We are a licensed Cremated Remains Disposer CRD license #838. For disposition in the waters off of the Santa Cruz County coast, a proper Permit for Disposition of Cremated Remains must be obtained through the Santa Cruz County Office of Vital Records <em>(831) 763-8430.</em></p>

					<p class="c b">To reserve your private charter, please call us at (831) 427-0230.</p>

					<p class="c i">As the waters of a river flow to the sea, the path determined by the line of the valley, so we pass through life to death, our destiny mapped out by your will.</p>

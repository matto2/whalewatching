					<p>The Santa Cruz Harbor is open and whale watching trips are running daily for Spring Break!</p>
					<p>Thursday 3/31— We saw a BLUE WHALE! Plus a gray whale close drive by – a couple of folks got "spouted" on!</p>
					<p>Tuesday 3/29—2 humpback whales, spotted just about a mile out from Santa Cruz. One was playing in the kelp and came up out of the water with a comical seaweed wig! We also saw a gray whale, and 200 common dolphins, bow riding and doing flips</p>

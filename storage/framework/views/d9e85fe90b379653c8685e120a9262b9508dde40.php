					<p>Visiting the San Francisco Bay Area? Or maybe you live in San Francisco and have out-of-town guests visiting?

					<p><em>Whale watching on Monterey Bay makes a great day trip for kids!</em> You will never forget the looks on their faces as they see their first Humpback Whale, Gray Whale or Blue Whale breach the surface on their first California whale watching trip out of Santa Cruz Harbor by Stagnaro Charters! Our expert crew is the very best in the biz at spotting whales in Monterey Bay and will get you out to the animals quickly and safely.

					<p>Past customers have seen a variety of wildlife on our boat trips, from pods of Blue and California Gray Whales to sea lions, sea otters, and dolphins! Humpback Whales frequent Monterey Bay from May through November and our summer guests often see Humpbacks feeding. Monterey Bay sees whales all year round! In the winter until the spring Gray Whale season prevails. The chance of sighting California Gray Whales during this period is around 90% as they migrate from cold arctic waters to the warm Baja Peninsula. Learn more about the whales of Monterey Bay and come aboard one of our trips to see them for yourself!</p>

					<p>The Santa Cruz harbor and waterfront is known for its beautiful scenery, sightseeing, the famous California sea lions, dining, gift shops, and more. A plethora of fresh seafood restaurants await you as you sit outside and sip on a refreshing drink while you gaze at the gorgeous California coastline and listen to the sounds of the nearby sea lions and other marine life. The atmosphere at the harbor is fun and exciting, with numerous events taking place throughout the year, from a festival of artists to a fireworks show on the 4th of July.</p>

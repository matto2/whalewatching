					<p>Friday, November 7, 2014: Whale watching today on sparkling autumn waters we had a great whale and dolphin show, beautiful ocean conditions!</p>
					<p>Near Moss Landing, we watched 15 humpback whales lunge feeding all afternoon. Surface behaviors including a head slap, and breaching! We had about 5-6 minutes with friendly humpbacks swimming near to the boat. Another loner juvenile whale was spotted exploring near Pleasure Point.</p>
					<p>We got some photos of "Shred" a humpback whale with distinctive injured tail, most likely bitten at by Orcas. We've been seeing this guy in the Monterey Bay over spring and summer.</p>

					<p>On Wednesday's trip we had "ride-along" bottlenose dolphins right out of the harbor. A group of 6 dolphins rode the bow with us for about 20 minutes! We traveled out to Moss Landing to see 8-10 whales feeding, tail slaps, breaching. And we saw Risso's dolphins on the way back in towards Santa Cruz.</p>

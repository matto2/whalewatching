					<p>Spring is here and so are humpback whale arriving for their feeding season in Monterey Bay. Gray whales continue their northbound migration through our local waters, and dolphin &amp; otter babies are learning to keep up with their folks. Here is what we've seen lately in Monterey Bay.</p>

					<p>3/20/16 For Sunday's trip, the best report came from one of our passengers, who wrote, "We had clear skies, a smooth trip, and good sightings. There was a small group of about 20 common dolphins porpoising. We then saw a yearling humpback surfacing then diving to feed near the canyon. Later, we came upon another young humpback."</p>
					<p>Saturday 3/19 we saw 500 common dolphins, 3 humpback whales — close drive-bys, lots of flukes, plus otters!</p>
					<p>And on Thursday 3/18 we saw otters, lots of dolphins and 6 humpback whales out in Monterey Bay. One of the whales was lunge feeding. Lovely!</p>

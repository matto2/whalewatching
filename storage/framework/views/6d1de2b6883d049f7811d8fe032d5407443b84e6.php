					<p><em>Wednesday June 8</em> – Today we came across a frisky humpback who put on a show: breaching, chin slaps, tail slaps and feeding for over an hour. A great day on Monterey Bay! #WorldOceansDay</p>
					<p><em>Monday, June 6</em> – Amazing encounters with orca and humpback whales! We came across 8 playful and friendly orcas who came right up to the boat. It seemed the older animals were training infant orcas to leap and lunge. The humpbacks were sleepy but showed some tail slapping/ curled fluke slapping, too.</p>

					<p>Saturday 4/23 we had a friendly juvenile humpback whale investigate the boat, out near the Monterey Canyon, and spotted several other humpbacks in the area. Then we swung up the coast by the cement ship in hopes of seeing some sharks. Indeed, we spotted a great white shark scavenging a small gray whale carcass in shallow water off the beach. It was amazing to watch.</p>

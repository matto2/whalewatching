					<p><em>Why is the Monterey Bay so richly diverse in marine life?</em> It has been described as a confluence zone for many warm and cold waters species. That is, the southern-most boundary for many cold water mammals and fish yet the northern most boundary for many warm water species.</p>

					<p>The Monterey Bay is home to one of North America’s deepest and largest submarine canyons. Larger than the Grand Canyon, this deep ocean environment begins less than ½ mile from shore and extends to a depth of over 2 miles. Off shore traveling currents along the canyon walls create upwellings, which send plankton and nutrient rich waters to the surface. This is the basis of the ocean’s food chain. The canyon brings this deep-water environment within reach of our boats just a few miles out. In essence, Monterey Bay has become a gathering place for marine mammals, sea birds, and fish alike. The Monterey Bay has over 27 different types of marine mammals alone visiting year round!</p>

					<p>Sightings Report -Tuesday, February 10, 2015: a beautiful day on board Sea Stag Six for whale watching on Monterey Bay. We spent time watching a pair of humpback whales close to Santa Cruz, tail fluking and surface feeding, along with a pod of dolphin. The whales and dolphins were both feeding on small fish – we could see the feeder fish at the surface! Migrating gray whales could be seen from afar, passing through Monterey Bay.</p>

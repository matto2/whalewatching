					<p>Friday, February 20: We saw 8 humpback whales, a few came close to the boat! and 1000 common dolphins, bow riding alongside Velocity.</p>
					<p>Saturday, February 21: More humpback whales and a few gray whales passing through. We caught sight of about 100 common dolphins out in the Monterey Bay on Saturday.</p>
					<p>Sunday, February 22: Sunday whale watching trip – We saw 6-7 humpback whales together with gray whales! The grays and humpbacks were traveling and feeding together, following giant bait balls of anchovies. Joining in the active feeding were sea lions, pelicans, cormorants, gulls. It was quite a party about 6 miles out from Santa Cruz, just north of the Soquel Hole.</p>
					<p>Our dolphin sightings were up again on Sunday; we saw at least 1000 common dolphin enjoying life in the Bay!</p>

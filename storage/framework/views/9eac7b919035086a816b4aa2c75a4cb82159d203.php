					<p>Saturday, September 10:<br />There are several groups of humpback whales feeding just offshore from the Santa Cruz Harbor, but the highlight today were orcas! The orca put on a good show for our morning whale watching trip.</p>
					<p>Humpback whales are still here in Monterey Bay feeding closer to shore, as well as over the canyon. Conditions are lending themselves for surface feeding! We’ve seen a good amount of lunge feeding from some pretty big whales. They’re at their heaviest for the season. Dolphin sightings have included Risso’s and Long-beaked Common dolphins, as well as several harbor porpoise. There are still jellies around, and we’ve seen a few mola molas too.</p>
					<p>9/7 Wednesday – Humpbacks lunge feeding – nice close looks. To start the trip we were joined by a large pod of Risso’s Dolphins alongside theboat</p>
					<p>9/5 Monday – Labor Day – 10 humpback whales lunge feeding, and Orcas!</p>
					<p>9/4 Sun – Orcas swimming, bow riding under the boat!</p>

					<p>This week, many populations of humpback whale have been removed from the endangered species list, which is wonderful news! Our Monterey “Pacific Coast” population remains threatened, however. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/humpback-whale-endangered-list-pictures/" title="">Enjoy this wonderful photo gallery of our beloved humpback whale!</a></p>

					<h2>April 20: Gray whales and calves!</h2>
					<p>Wednesday Sightings: Today we spotted a large echelon of 7 gray whales along the Santa Cruz coastline; we were able to follow along their path up towards Long Marine Lab. There were at least 2 calves in the group, who were unusually curious, popping their heads above water. Neat interactions! Then we found a few groups of humpback whales near Santa Cruz — Beautiful calm day on the bay!</p>

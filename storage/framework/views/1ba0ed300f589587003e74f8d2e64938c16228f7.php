					<p>Sunday, September 14, 2014: Yesterday our whale watching trip was another rewarding adventure! We had a great group of visitors from around the world to our next door neighbors, sharing the wonders of Monterey Bay marine life. Among the sights:</p>
					<ul>						
						<li>100s of common dolphins</li>
						<li>Humpback whales – One big breach near to the boat!</li>
						<li>Dozens of otters and California sea lions</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="callout">
						<p>After the trip we received a note from one of our guests, Tina, who wrote:</p>
						<p>"We were so lucky; we got to see so many whales, a slumber party of otters and some beautiful dolphins and sea lions. The highlight was obviously when one of the humpbacks decided to breach and I was so astounded, that I did not get it on film but I did get lots of pictures of gorgeous whale tails and of course the otters"</p>

					<p>Well, Tina, we have that moment for you with this photo sent in by another passenger!</p>

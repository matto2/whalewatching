					<h1>Monterey Bay whales breaching, tail slapping and feeding on anchovies</h1>
					<p>Saturday, September 14, 2013: Easy breezy! Yesterday we saw 30 – 40 humpback whales feasting on anchovies in the Monterey Bay. Late summer ocean conditions are attractive to large schools of anchovies, creating an abundant food source for the whales.</p>

					<p>Well-fed and energetic whales were breaching again and again above the waters near Santa Cruz. Breaching is when a whale propels itself at least two-thirds out of the water, spins and lands on its back. What a splash!</p>
					<p>Tail slapping is when a whale slaps its tail on the water surface repeatedly, up to 25-30 times! The sound can echo under water for some distance. This behavior is thought to be a means of communication among the whales.</p>
					<p>Our local newspaper, the Santa Cruz Sentinel published an article today about the record numbers of humpback whales in Monterey Bay this year! Click here to read all about it: A whale of a time: Anchovies bring record numbers of humpbacks</p>

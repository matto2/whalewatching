						<p>Stagnaro's is actively participating in local government and CDC guidelines in an effort to slow the spreading of COVID-19. We want to share with you the actions we’re taking to help you stay healthy and enjoy a whale watching or fishing trip on Monterey Bay:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We are limiting our larger vessel to a maximum capacity to 40 passengers and limiting our smaller vessel to a maximum 30 passengers in an effort to provide maximum spacing between people while onboard.</li>
							<li>We are actively sanitizing hand rails, door handles and arm rests throughout the duration of each trip.</li>
							<li>While on board, we are encouraging people to spend most of their time out on deck in the fresh sea air and not congregate in the cabins and indoor seating areas.</li>
							<li>Discouraging people from gathering in tight groups around the outdoor boarding area at the Santa Cruz Harbor.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All public trips are as of now scheduled to proceed as planned. However, please check with our office for any current evolutions or changes to our schedule. We can be reached at 831-427-2334 or 831-427-0230, or send email to  info@stagnaros.com with any questions or concerns.</p> -->

					<p>Santa Cruz Whale Watching offers seven different species of Whales and seven different species of Dolphin &amp; Porpoise year-round. The Humpback Whale is the most common whale found out of Santa Cruz, seen usually from April through November. Then from December through April, over 20,000 Gray Whales pass through our waters off of Monterey Bay. Sea Lions, Seals, Otters and nearly one hundred different species of sea birds, both endemic and migratory, are common; Even Sea Turtles, Jellies, Sunfish (mola mola) and Sharks at times can be seen at the surface. Our boat, the Velocity, can quickly and safely bring guests to wherever these animals are—from the shores of Monterey to Moss Landing and points North.</p>
